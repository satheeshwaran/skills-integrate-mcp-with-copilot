## Teacher Accounts

Teacher usernames/passwords are stored in `src/teachers.json` and validated by the backend.

Default test credentials:

- `ms_smith` / `teach123`
- `mr_johnson` / `class456`

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
